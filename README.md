# Natural Language Understanding - Assignment 2

This repository contains the material required to complete the second assignment of the Natural Language Understanding course. It is composed of:
1. A .py file;
2. A README.md file;
3. A .ipynb notebook.

## Requirements

In order to run the code, you need to install `spacy` via the package manager [pip] or another preferred method.


## Usage
The collection of functions makes use of the main `spaCy` objects and methods for named entity recognition and dependency parsing. Detailed comments on the rationale behind each specific function can be found on the .py file itself. The code can be simply executed via:

```bash
python assignment2.py
```

It will output the results of the testing made on the functions.



## Purpose
This repository has the main purpose of fulfilling the requests for the Natural Language Understanding course's second assignment.
